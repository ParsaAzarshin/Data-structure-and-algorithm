# 🚀 HashMap-Based Problems (JavaScript)

This folder contains fundamental **HashMap and Frequency Counter algorithms**
frequently appearing in technical interviews.

Each file adheres to the analytical structure defined for DSA learning:
- 🧩 Problem statement
- 📋 Requirements & constraints
- 🔍 Step-by-step decomposition
- 💻 JavaScript implementation (Naive → Optimized)
- 🧮 Time & Space Complexity analysis

## Core Pattern
The **Frequency Counter Pattern** leverages objects (or `Map`) in JavaScript
to achieve element-frequency tracking in **O(n)** time.
This drastically improves performance compared to nested-loop approaches (**O(n²)**).

It’s widely used in:
- Counting elements (characters, numbers)
- Anagram checking
- Duplicate detection
- Comparing multisets
- Grouping occurrences

## File List

| # | Problem | Concepts | Complexity |
|---|----------|-----------|-------------|
| 01 | Frequency Counter Pattern | HashMap Fundamentals | O(n) |
| 02 | Valid Anagram | Frequency Counter + HashMap | O(n) |
| 03 | Count Unique Values | HashMap Counting Logic | O(n) |
| 04 | Character Occurrence Analysis | HashMap Iteration | O(n) |

### 🧠 Upcoming Topics
After consolidating Frequency Counter basics, we’ll move deeper into:
- **Pattern Hashing** (e.g., Group Anagrams)
- **Set / Map Optimizations**
- **HashSet Uniqueness**
- **Prefix Counting via Map Structures**

---

### 📘 Study Tip
Focus first on understanding how frequency maps replace nested comparisons.
Once you’re fluent with this pattern, every next HashMap problem becomes trivial.
